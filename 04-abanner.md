## Article Banners
Since Bitcoin Txoko is frequently writing guides and explainers, a clean article banner would make the blog much more visually appealing. It can also convey useful information and make it a better user experience for the reader. For example, the article banner for a guide can contain icons to indicate difficulty, time and tools required, icons to help users identify the technology they are learning about, like app icons.
