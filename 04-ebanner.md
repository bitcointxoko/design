## Event Banners (Posters)
Event banners/posters will be used to publicise upcoming events, in way like those used on [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com). 

Going forward we will probably separate events into two kinds. First are regular meetups, where there is no specific topic and people come together mainly to chat informally. Regular meetups would be more oriented towards the general audience with no pre-requisite knowledge. The setting is generally a cafe/bar/restaurant. Second are workshops, where we take a deep dive into a specific topic. This can be hands-on, like setting up a [BoltCard](./06-boltcard.md) or [SeedSigner](./07-seedsigner.md), or theoretical. These require some pre-requisite knowledge and are more oriented towards enthusiastic learners. The setting is a classroom at [Izarra Centre](https://www.izarracentre.com/) in Ermua.
