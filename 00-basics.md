## Basics
Setting up the basics first will probably simplify things later on as these components will be frequently reused. Having said that, it could be a good idea to first skim through the rest of the guide to gauge what kind of things will be designed. 

### Colours
The colours will be used in almost everything we see. They will be used to theme websites, they can be used in logos and banners, they can feature on hardware and merch. 

For example, colours can be used to theme the [BTCpayserver](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Development/Theme/) shop. 

To help you get started, have a look at Nostr Design's general UI [tips](https://nostrdesign.org/docs/design-principles/ui-tips/#color).

Some considerations: 
- orange is frequently used to denote Bitcoin.
- yellow is sometimes used to denote Lightning. 
- purple is frequently used to denote Nostr.

Since these themes are highly likely to appear alongside Bitcoin Txoko's visual identity, the colours shouldn't conflict too much with the mentioned colours. Another thing is that overusing these colours can be a bit clich√© so something with more personality could be nice. 

Some other considerations: 
- accessibility: is there enough contrast? [Colour Contrast Checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/)
- does it look good in dark **and** light modes?

If you need inspiration, check artists and other communities in the [Resources](./resources.md) document. 

#### Requirements
The goal is to decide on a maximum of three colours (primary, secondary and tertiary), less than three is okay. We can adjust the colour accent for if required for specific things.  The desired format is a hex colour code for each colour. 


### Typography(?)
Typography isn't too high on the priority list since default fonts are mostly fine. But deciding on a nice typography could help you in the process of designing things like [event banners](./04-ebanner.md) (posters). We can also use the font on our [blog](https://blog.bitcointxoko.com). 

The logo text currently uses the Vasca font. You can find in in the [Resources](./resources.md) document.
