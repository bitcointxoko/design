## Basics
Setting up the basics first will probably simplify things later on as these components will be frequently reused. Having said that, it could be a good idea to first skim through the rest of the guide to gauge what kind of things will be designed. 

### Colours
The colours will be used in almost everything we see. They will be used to theme websites, they can be used in logos and banners, they can feature on hardware and merch. 

To help you get started, have a look at Nostr Design's general UI [tips](https://nostrdesign.org/docs/design-principles/ui-tips/#color).

Some considerations: 
- orange is frequently used to denote Bitcoin.
- yellow is sometimes used to denote Lightning. 
- purple is frequently used to denote Nostr. 

Some other considerations: 
- accessibility: is there enough contrast? [Colour Contrast Checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/)
- does it look good in dark **and** light modes?

If you need inspiration, check artists and other communities in the [Resources](./resources.md) document. 

#### Requirements
The goal is to decide on a primary, secondary and tertiary colour.
