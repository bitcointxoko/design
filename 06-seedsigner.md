## SeedSigner
A [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) is a DIY bitcoin hardware signer. We will probably have some workshops teaching how to assemble and use them in the coming months. What's cool is we can 3D print cases in custom colours for them using [example templates](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/tree/dev/enclosures). We can sell the custom cases in the shop and fund designers with the profits.
