## How to use this guide
### Easy
The easiest way to use this guide is to download it to your computer and read it with a markdown notes app like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

To save this repository to your computer, find the green `Code` button and press `Download ZIP`. 

Unzip the `.zip` file. 

Install Obsidian and point a new vault to the unzipped folder by choosing the `Open folder as vault` option. 

The disadvantage of using the guide this way is that every time the guide is updated you need to download the whole thing again. 

### Advanced
To track changes and versioning more easily you can take advantage of `git`, but this requires touching the command line. 

First you'd need to have `git` installed on your computer. Assuming you use a Mac, go to [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) and install Homebrew. 

Once Homebrew is done installing, you can install `git` with this command. 

```
brew install git
```

To clone this repository to your computer, use this command. 

```
git clone https://github.com/bitcointxoko/design.git
```

You should now have a `design` folder on your computer. You can open it in Obsidian like described in the Easy section.
