## Profile Banner
The profile banner will be shown on the organisation's profile page as shown in the previous [section](./01-logo.md). 

It can also be the banner for the Reddit-like [community](https://satellite.earth/n/BitcoinTxoko/npub1tx0k0a7lw62vvqax6p3ku90tccgdka7ul4radews2wrdsg0m865szf9fw6).

This is our current banner, just quickly made in ASCII art, so a redesign is probably much needed. 

### Requirements
- rectangle
  - on satellite.earth it's 3:1.
  - on snort.social it's 16:7.
  - probably make it 16:7 and use more margins on 3:1.
