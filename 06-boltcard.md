## BoltCard
A [BoltCard](https://boltcard.org/) is a NFC card that can make Bitcoin Lightning Network payments, kind of like a Lightning debit card ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLsZ9faRstY)). Community members can create their own cards using the [wallet](https://bitcointxoko.com/) hosted by Bitcoin Txoko. We're currently offering white PVC cards for sale on our [shop](https://shop.bitcointxoko.com) page. These cards can also be used as gift cards, where they can be topped up with a certain amount and given away as gifts. It would be really cool if we can also offer a couple of different designs and profits from card sales can be used to fund the designer(s). 

### Requirements
Requirements: 
- rounded rectangle 85.5 mm x 54 mm (two sides per card)
- two or three designs, including at least one "discreet" design with no obvious connection to bitcoin
- (suggested) integrate one or two 30 mm x 30 mm blank cutout for QR codes into the design, one for Lightning Address, another for Nostr npub. See #Suggested approach for details. 

### Suggested approach
The NFC card uses the same form factor that of a credit card or public transit card, so you can use one of those to trace an outline if desired. 

Since the wallets backing these BoltCards can have a receiving address too, these can be integrated into the card design in the form of a QR code on the back side of the card. This way the cardbearer can not only use their cards to spend but to receive as well. Consider making a blank square cutout in the card design where the QR code can be printed. 

Another thing we can do with QR codes is to display the cardholder's nostr npub (their public key) so that people can just scan their card and follow them on nostr. I don't think anyone has done this before so I think it would be really cool if you can be the first one to pull it off!

NoGood has made a printable zine ([download .zip](https://www.nogood.studio/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Printables-NoGood-SovereignElectronics.zip)) to showcase his NFC card designs.
